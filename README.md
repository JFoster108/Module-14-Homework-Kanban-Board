# Module-14-Homework-Kanban-Board

## Description

This is premade Kanban board application where I added a JWT authentication to allow users to login to their specific account, as well as updated the front end code to fix some errors and look more unique. I then connected the PostgreSQL Database, and deployed the website all on Render. This is a homework assignment for the web development bootcamp sponsored by UNC Chapel Hill.
