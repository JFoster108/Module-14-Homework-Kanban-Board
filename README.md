# Module-14-Homework-Kanban-Board
This is premade Kanban board application where I added a JWT authentication token to allow users to login to their specific account, as well as updated the front end code to fix some errors and look more unique. This is a homework assignment for the web development bootcamp sponsored by UNC Chapel Hill.
